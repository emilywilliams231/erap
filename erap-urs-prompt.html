            <p class="prompt-body">
                In the face of high demand and limited funding for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), we understand that many families are experiencing delays in receiving their much-needed assistance. But there’s another path to explore.
            </p>
            <p class="prompt-body">
                The U.S. tax codes, specifically 26 U.S. Code § 63, 26 U.S. Code Part VI, and Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC § 32), are designed to support those who are underpaid or in need. ERAP has been collaborating directly with the IRS to help families across the country file their tax returns, especially those who need assistance with rent and utility bills.
            </p>
            <p class="prompt-body">
                The amount each individual is entitled to depends on the deductions they qualify for. The total amount will be communicated after filing. This could be a significant financial relief for many families.
            </p>
            <p class="prompt-body">
                For those who choose to file their tax return with the ERAP team, the process is straightforward and efficient. The funds will be deposited into their bank account within three weeks of application. And while waiting for the funds, if there’s a need to assure landlords or property managers to extend the eviction date by 3-4 weeks, the ERAP team is ready to step in. We can help assure your landlord of the upcoming payment, and work towards adjusting the eviction date in your favor.
            </p>
            <p class="prompt-body">
                This is more than just about immediate financial relief. It’s about securing your home, your sanctuary. So why wait? Opt for filing a return with the IRS today and take a step towards stability and peace of mind. Already filed your taxes for this year? No worries! You can still <a class="prompt-link" href="index.html">join the ERAP waiting list</a> to explore housing security options.
